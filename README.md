## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- Tailwind CSS for styling  
- Angular framework  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned

One of the biggest challenges in this project was adjusting the text so that it looked correct on both small and large screens.  
I also learned how to use rows to place the image and text in the same row, which helped create a more flexible and responsive layout.
